===========

Design Principles Used:
- Feedback about the call to the Instagram API by using a spinner. The spinner disappears when the page is loaded.
- Consistency throughout the application. All the pages have the same layout and content are placed in the same areas in all pages.
- Visibility of the system. All the buttons have names according to which page they redirects to.
